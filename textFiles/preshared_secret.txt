Sending the entire pre-shared secret is insecure due to the fact that if the password is intercepted, the controller could never be sure of the host's identity. Another machine could attempt to connect to the controller with the password and the controller would not be able to tell if it was the right machine. If the pre-shared secret was encrypted symmetrically, then while the digest could still be intercepted, the interceptor could not pretend to be the host since it would not know how to encrypt messages in the way that the controller would be expecting them.
