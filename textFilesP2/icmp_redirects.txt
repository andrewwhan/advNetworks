	A router issues an ICMP redirect when it finds a need to inform a host of certain routing information. Generally this is used to inform a host of a more direct route, and thus update the host route table to instead use the new and more efficent route. The impact of a redirect is that it can change the routing tables of a host, and tell it what it can and can't route through.
	There are scenarios where this will cause an issue with our system are in places where say we want host 3 to route all of its traffic to host 1 through host 2, so that host 2 can view host 3's traffic to host 1. An ICMP may notify host 3 that it can route directly to host 1, making it so that host 2 can no longer view all traffic between the two hosts. Essentailly ICMP redirects would be bad for us when we have a routing scenario set up that does not use the most efficient routes.
	This can be prevented by configuring our hosts with a firewall rule that drops any packets using ICMP, or having the hosts drop any packets that have to do with ICMP.
