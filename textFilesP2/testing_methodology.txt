We begin by connecting two of the four hosts by running sudo ./agent.

Test a simple command on one of them like: 
alias show hostX.team3.4516.cs.wpi.edu
in order to demonstrate that the program does not block while still waiting for other hosts to connect.

Show that a command directed at a host that hasn't connected yet returns an error and doesn't break the program:
alias show hostX.team3.4516.cs.wpi.edu (where X has not connected yet)

Connect the rest of the hosts to the controller using sudo ./agent.

Show the aliases of a host before manipulating them:
alias show hostX.team3.4516.cs.wpi.edu
This will tell us what the current state of the host in terms of its alias's

alias add hostX.team3.4516.cs.wpi.edu 128::256 eth0:0
This command should add the ip alias 128::256 to the specified host. To check this we run 
alias show hostX.team3.4516.cs.wpi.edu

This is to ensure that the alias was correctly added.
then we remove the address with
alias remove hostX.team3.4516.cs.wpi.edu 128::256 eth0:0

alias show hostX.team3.4516.cs.wpi.edu
This will show us that the remove was successful, and that all the alias commands work

If we want to really make sure it is adding and removing the address we can use ping6 or ssh into the host and use ifconfig there.

Then we test the nat commands using a similar process:
nat show hostX.team3.4516.cs.wpi.edu
This will tell us what the current state of the host in terms of its nat rules

nat add hostX.team3.4516.cs.wpi.edu PREROUTING 1 -d 2607:f5c0:8010:c0de:4516:3:0:1 -j DNAT --to-destination 2607:f5c0:8010:c0de:4516:3:0:4
This command should add the described nat rule to the specified host.

To check this we run 
nat show hostX.team3.4516.cs.wpi.edu
This is to ensure that the nat rule was correctly added.

then we remove the nat rule with
nat remove hostX.team3.4516.cs.wpi.edu PREROUTING -d 2607:f5c0:8010:c0de:4516:3:0:1 -j DNAT --to-destination 2607:f5c0:8010:c0de:4516:3:0:4

and check with
nat show hostX.team3.4516.cs.wpi.edu
This will show us that the remove was successful, and that all the nat commands work.
Again, we can ssh into a host and show the current ip6table nat rules to confirm that everything is functional.
