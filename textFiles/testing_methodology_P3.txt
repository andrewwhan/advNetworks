# test table, route, and rule support
Show we can add routing tables to hosts.
table add host2.team3.4516.cs.wpi.edu bork

Then we will show that adding routes to those tables is fully funcitonal.
route add host2.team3.4516.cs.wpi.edu 2607:f5c0:8010:c0de:4516:3:0:4 via 2607:f5c0:8010:c0de:4516:3:0:3 dev eth0 table bork
route show host2.team3.4516.cs.wpi.edu bork

Then we show that adding rules referencing tables is functional.
rule add host2.team3.4516.cs.wpi.edu to 2607:f5c0:8010:c0de:4516:3:0:4 table bork
rule show host2.team3.4516.cs.wpi.edu

Then we will show that all the rules will properly set up the network to route host2's traffic to host4 through host 3.
We will tracert6 from host2 to host4. The results prove the success of our commands.
tracert6 host4.team3.4516.cs.wpi.edu

Then we will show that all of our remove commands are functional.
rule remove host2.team3.4516.cs.wpi.edu to 2607:f5c0:8010:c0de:4516:3:0:4 table bork
rule show host2.team3.4516.cs.wpi.edu
route remove host2.team3.4516.cs.wpi.edu 2607:f5c0:8010:c0de:4516:3:0:4 via 2607:f5c0:8010:c0de:4516:3:0:3 dev eth0 table bork
route show host2.team3.4516.cs.wpi.edu bork
table remove host2.team3.4516.cs.wpi.edu bork


# test firewall support
firerule add host1.team3.4516.cs.wpi.edu OUTPUT 1 -j DROP -p udp
then we can check IPv6 UDP connectivity of the host from the VM console
firerule show host1.team3.4516.cs.wpi.edu
This show will confirm the rule has been added to host1
firerule remove host1.team3.4516.cs.wpi.edu OUTPUT -j DROP -p udp
then we can check to see that IPv6 UDP connectivity has returned to host1 with the VM console


# test neighbor discovery cache manipulation
neigh show host3.team3.4516.cs.wpi.edu
Show the current state of the ndc
neigh add host3.team3.4516.cs.wpi.edu 252::234 a3:32:45:f1:12:01
Add a neighbor with an IP address, accessible via a HW address
neigh show host3.team3.4516.cs.wpi.edu
Show that the neighbor has been added
neigh remove host3.team3.4516.cs.wpi.edu 252::234 a3:32:45:f1:12:01
Remove the neighbor
neigh show host3.team3.4516.cs.wpi.edu
Show that the neighbor has been removed
