We are going to test that our program automatically updates the network in accordance with its rules when a machine cannot route correctly.
First we will remove the routes to other hosts from host1 using the route remove command.
Then we will start a ping6 from host1 to host2. This ping will fail to complete.
Then we will start our controller. After that, we will start the agent.
Then we will check the ping, and if the ping is funcitonal, the controller has successfully corrected the network.
We will also view the output logs to show the following:
1) The agent recieves unroutable packets from its tunnel.
2) The host properly wraps 1200 of the bytes in the packets being elevated, and then sends that message to the controller.
3) The controller properly recieves and handles the elevated packet.
4) The controller consults its rule book, and dispaches commands appropriately.
5) The hosts recieve those commands and executes the commands.
6) The controller sends the message to either resend or drop the packet.
7) The host properly drops the packet. Resending is not functional.
If all of these are true, we have, for the most part, completed phase 4.
