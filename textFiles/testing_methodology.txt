We started by testing the alias commands:
alias show hostX.team3.4516.cs.wpi.edu
This will tell us what the current state of the host in terms of its alias's
alias add hostX.team3.4516.cs.wpi.edu 128::256 eth0:0
This command should add the ip alias 128::256 to the specified host. Check this we run 
alias show hostX.team3.4516.cs.wpi.edu
This is to ensure that the alias was correctly added.
then we remvoe the address with
alias remove hostX.team3.4516.cs.wpi.edu 128::256 eth0:0
alias show hostX.team3.4516.cs.wpi.edu
This will show us that the remove was successful, and that all the alias commands work
If we want to really make sure it is adding and removing the address we can use ping6 or ssh into the host and use ifconfig there.

Then we test the nat commands using a similar process:
nat show hostX.team3.4516.cs.wpi.edu
This will tell us what the current state of the host in terms of its nat rules
nat add hostX.team3.4516.cs.wpi.edu PREROUTING 1 -d 2607:f5c0:8010:c0de:4516:3:0:1 -j DNAT --to-destination 2607:f5c0:8010:c0de:4516:3:0:4
This command should add the described nat rule to the specified host. Check this we run 
nat show hostX.team3.4516.cs.wpi.edu
This is to ensure that the nat rule was correctly added.
then we remvoe the nat rule with
nat remove hostX.team3.4516.cs.wpi.edu PREROUTING -d 2607:f5c0:8010:c0de:4516:3:0:1 -j DNAT --to-destination 2607:f5c0:8010:c0de:4516:3:0:4
nat show hostX.team3.4516.cs.wpi.edu
This will show us that the remove was successful, and that all the nat commands work.
Again, we can ssh into a host and show the current ip6table nat rules to confirm that everything is functional.
